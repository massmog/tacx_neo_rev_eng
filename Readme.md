# tacx_neo_rev_eng

Welcome to the **tacx_neo_rev_eng** repository. This project serves as a collaborative workspace for the **reverse engineering** of the TACX NEO SMART trainer's internal electronics.

## Project Status: Draft

This is currently a **work-in-progress** and should be considered a draft. The primary goal is to document the hardware architecture to better understand the trainer's power management and communication protocols.

### Contents

* **High-Resolution Photographs:** Detailed imagery of the TACX NEO SMART trainer PCB.
* **Schematic Sketch:** Simplified schematic of the PCB, which shows mostly the power supply
* *Note: These schematics are currently **incomplete** and may contain placeholders*

### Disclaimer

This project is for educational and diagnostic purposes only. Messing with your trainer's internals may void your warranty or lead to hardware failure. Proceed with caution!
